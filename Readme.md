A recommendation system for books using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and the Book-Crossings dataset. Processed and cleaned the dataset using Python and Pandas to ensure data quality and consistency. Implemented NearestNeighbors from the Scikit-Learn library to generate book recommendations based on user input. Created a custom function that takes a book title as input and outputs a list of 5 relevant books, using a distance metric to determine similarity. Utilized Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib to visualize the data and evaluate model performance. Achieved an accuracy of X%.
